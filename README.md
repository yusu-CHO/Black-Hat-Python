# Black-Hat-Python
Source code for the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz.
This repository contains #a modified version of the source code from Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz.#

Several parts of the original example code were commented out or incomplete.
In this version, those sections have been uncommented and extended with additional logic so that the examples function correctly as intended.

Additionally, the required bash commands for generating an SSH host key have been included to ensure proper execution of the SSH-related examples.

This modified version was created to assist readers who are studying the book and encounter issues where the provided example code does not work out of the box.
